# Distributed-file-sharing
Users who are working in the same field of interest usually need a platform where they can exchange their files without problems. Our goal is to build a distributed system to allow multiple users to get some files from that platform at the same time. The users should always be able to access the files without data loss or system termination.  
To make this possible, we build an environment with a main server supported by two replica servers. The replica servers will always be on the same state of the main server through multicast communication. In addition, the replica servers will take over in case of a failure of the main server and prevent a breakdown. To avoid inconsistence of the file to transmit, we use a Network Attached Storage served by a router where the files are stored. The servers all access this storage. This also ensures that the file is not lost if a server crashes. So, there is no possibility that wrong files are sent. To select a leader among our servers, we use the LaLenn-Cheng-Roberts algorithm. This looks for the ID's of the servers and compares them to select a leader. Furthermore, we use vector clocks to avoid and detect causality violations. The vector clocks provide the messages with timestamps to ensure that the causality violation is traceable.
